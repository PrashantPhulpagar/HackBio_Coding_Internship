#@markdown ### **Key Insights**
#@markdown - The most impacted amino acid is crucial for protein stability or function, affecting folding or interactions.
#@markdown - High-frequency mutations occur in structurally important (e.g., Î±-helices, Î²-sheets) or functionally critical (e.g., active sites, binding regions) residues.
#@markdown - Hydrophobic mutations can disrupt stability, while hydrophilic ones may alter solubility or enzymatic activity.
#@markdown - These hotspots indicate strong selective pressure and potential functional significance.
