I started by creating a dictionary called personal_profile. This dictionary is where I'm going to keep all the information for the profile. I used key-value pairs to organize the data.  Each key is like a label (for example, "name", "email", "hobby"), and the value is the actual information itself.
Then, I put all the profile details into the personal_profile dictionary. I added my name, Slack username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred programming language.  So, for example, the key "name" has the value "Prashant Phulpagar", and the key "hobby" has the value "Playing Badminton".
Next, I wanted to display this information nicely.  I used a bunch of print statements to do this.  To make the output look good, I used f-strings.  These let me put the values from the dictionary directly into the text I'm printing. So, print(f"Name: {personal_profile['name']}") takes the value associated with the "name" key and inserts it into the string.
So, basically, I used a dictionary to store the data and then printed it out.
